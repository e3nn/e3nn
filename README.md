# e3nn

**[Documentation](https://docs.e3nn.org)** | **[Code](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)**

The aim of this library it to help the developement of E3 equivariant neural networks.
It contains fundamental mathematical operations such as tensor products and spherical harmonics.

## Installation
```
pip install e3nn
```

### Previous version
e3nn has been recently refactored. The last version before refactoring can be installed with the command
```
pip install e3nn==0.1.1
```
