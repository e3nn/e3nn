**[Documentation](https://docs.e3nn.org)** | **[Code](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)** | **[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn/blob/main/.github/CHANGELOG.md)** | **[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gps7mMOmzLe3Rt_b012xsz4UyuexTKAf?usp=sharing)**

The aim of this library is to help the development of [E(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group) equivariant neural networks.
It contains fundamental mathematical operations such as [tensor products](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/stable/api/o3/o3_tp.html) and [spherical harmonics](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/stable/api/o3/o3_sh.html).

## Installation

**Important:** install pytorch and only then run the command

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade e3nn
```

For details and optional dependencies, see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

### Breaking changes
e3nn is under development.
It is recommanded to install using pip. The main branch is considered as unstable.
The second version number is incremented every time a breaking change is made to the code.
```
0.(increment when backwards incompatible release).(increment for backwards compatible release)
```
