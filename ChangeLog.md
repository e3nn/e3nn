and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Recursive TorchScript compiler `e3nn.util.jit`
- TorchScript support for `TensorProduct` and subclasses, `NormActivation`, `Gate`, `FullyConnectedNet`, and `gate_points_2101.Network`
### Removed
- swish, use `torch.nn.functional.silu` instead
- `"cartesian_vectors"` for equivariance testing â€” since the 0.2.2 Euler angle convention change, L=1 irreps are equivalent

## [0.2.2] - 2021-02-09
### Changed
- Euler angle convention from ZYZ to YXY
- `TensorProduct.weight_shapes` content put into `TensorProduct.instructions`

### Added
- Better TorchScript support
