"""This module provides functions for computing spherical harmonics and associated
Legendre polynomials on 3D points using PyTorch. It leverages caching and JIT compilation
for efficient batch processing on CPU or GPU devices.

The main functions include:
- `calc_Ylm`: Computes spherical harmonics up to a given degree for a set of points.
- `calc_Plm`: Calculates associated Legendre polynomials for cos(theta) values.

Utilizing memoization, intermediate results such as 'A' and 'B' coefficients and factorials
are stored for repeated use. The JIT-compiled functions offer optimized computation
for these mathematical constructs essential in fields such as quantum mechanics,
electromagnetics, and computer graphics.
